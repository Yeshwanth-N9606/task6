|---------------------------|----------------|----------|
| robert                    | Weak           | Only lowercase letters, very short |
| Samantha&Sky88            | Very Strong    | Good mix + length, harder to guess |
| Mustang@River!Drive2025   | Extremely Strong | Long, varied characters, high resistance to attacks |

*(Scores will vary slightly depending on the password checker used.)*

## 💡 Best Practices for Strong Passwords
1. Use at least **12–16 characters**.
2. Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
3. Avoid personal info like birthdays or names of family/pets.
4. Use **passphrases** that are easy to remember but hard to guess.
5. Change passwords regularly.
6. Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** whenever possible.

## 🔍 Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries every possible combination until the correct password is found.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a list of common words to guess passwords.
- **Phishing Attack**: Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake websites or messages.
- **Keylogging**: Records keystrokes to steal login credentials.

## 📄 Conclusion
Complexity and length both play critical roles in password security. Human-like but unpredictable passwords that combine words, symbols, and numbers offer the best protection. Pairing them with MFA further strengthens security.
